        "Até agora, realizamos o fine-tuning do modelo Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B utilizando uma abordagem progressivamente mais eficiente. Inicialmente, ajustamos todos os parâmetros do modelo (modelos do 1 ao 6), mas depois optamos por congelar todas as camadas do transformador, exceto a última (modelo 7), para focar o ajuste apenas nas partes mais relevantes para a nova tarefa. Essa estratégia preserva o conhecimento pré-treinado nas camadas anteriores, economiza recursos computacionais e minimiza o risco de overfitting. Além disso, utilizamos técnicas avançadas como LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), que permite ajustar apenas subcomponentes específicos, como projeções de atenção e MLP, em vez de todo o modelo, e aplicamos quantização em 4 bits para reduzir o consumo de memória. Com essas abordagens, realizamos o fine-tuning de forma eficiente, concentrando os ajustes nas partes mais críticas do modelo, mantendo a estabilidade e acelerando o treinamento."

Primeiramente, removeria palavras comuns (\"a, de, o, ou, etc.\"), aplicaria stemming para reduzir as palavras às suas formas básicas, converteria todo o texto em minúsculas e aplicaria vetorização das instruções com TF-IDF para adicionar um nível de importância às palavras. Também seria útil capturar o contexto semântico, medir a similaridade textual e trabalhar com clustering (a técnica depende muito do comportamento dos dados). Outras abordagens podem ser exploradas conforme os resultados dessas técnicas sejam analisados."
